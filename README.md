# Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage the dependencies of your project. To create a virtual environment, make sure you have Python and virtualenv installed. Then, run the following commands in your terminal:

<code>$ python -m venv venv </code>
<code>$ source venv/bin/activate </code>


# Installing Dependencies

To install the required packages, run the following command:
<code>$ pip install -r requirements.txt</code>


This will install all the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. If you add any new dependencies to your project, run the following command to update the `requirements.txt` file:
<code>$ pip freeze > requirements.txt</code>
